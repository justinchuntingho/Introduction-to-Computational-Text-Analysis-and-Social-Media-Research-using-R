Nicola Sturgeon did not suddenly turn forgetful. “She is not free and clear. The First Minister promised to ‘respect the decisions’ of both inquiry reports, not to pick and choose which one suits her and try to discredit the other. “The SNP spin machine will go into hyper-drive to again attack the committee report because they’re running scared of its findings. They have accelerated the Vote of No Confidence in Nicola Sturgeon to avoid MSPs scrutinising that report. “As James Hamilton says, it is up to the Scottish Parliament to decide if the First Minister has been misleading. “This report does not change the overwhelming evidence that Nicola Sturgeon misled Parliament, her government badly let women down and wasted more than £500,000 of taxpayers’ money. “If Nicola Sturgeon won’t accept responsibility, then I urge opposition parties to back our Vote of No Confidence. “Nationalist or unionist, left or right, none of the usual political divisions matter now.

Full statement from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross here 👇 “If the First Minister’s side were aware of complaints against Alex Salmond in February 2018, an outrageous breach of those women’s privacy and confidentiality has occurred. “February 2018 is also two months before Nicola Sturgeon originally claimed to find out about complaints. If her chief of staff knew then, and was interfering in the investigation, it blows another enormous hole in the First Minister’s story. “If civil servants said the First Minister’s chief of staff was interfering in the investigation in a ‘very bad’ way, then that is a sacking offence. It raises serious questions about how she tried to interfere, how she found out, who told her, when she knew, and who she went on to tell. “It further raises the question if anyone told Nicola Sturgeon that her chief of staff was interfering in the investigation. If they did, a number of lies have been told to the Scottish Parliament. If they didn’t, it still makes Nicola Sturgeon’s story of when she claims to have found out about complaints even more implausible. “These are all ‘ifs’.

"Scottish Conservatives","ScottishConservatives","2021-03-05 20:18:30 CET","Photo","Devastating new documents confirm that Nicola Sturgeon ""discounted"" legal advice for a month and lost more than £500,000 of taxpayers' money in the Alex Salmond case. This is another crushing blow to her chances of surviving this scandal. We won't stop holding her to account. Full statement from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross “These are some of the devastating documents that the First Minister hoped would never get out. The SNP fought two votes in the Scottish Parliament to shut them down and waited until after Nicola Sturgeon’s evidence session to release it. “It’s beyond dispute that the government hid evidence from their own lawyers and then “discounted” their advice, as Roddy Dunlop QC put it. “These new documents show Nicola Sturgeon thought she was a better lawyer than Queen’s Counsel. She was emphatically wrong and it cost taxpayers more than £500,000. “The government was advised to concede a month before they did. Then they ran up an even bigger bill for weeks after they had been told the case was unstatable, the minimum requirement to proceed. “Their case was doomed from the start but they hid the evidence from their own lawyers, to the embarrassment and utter dismay of Roddy Dunlop QC. “The fact there are missing minutes from the meeting that Nicola Sturgeon herself attended confirms this is a cover up. Crucial evidence has been hidden. “The SNP thought Nicola Sturgeon had been exonerated by an evidence session where she failed to answer questions more than 100 times. “After the revelations of these latest documents, the First Minister’s position is more unstable than ever. This is a crushing blow to Nicola Sturgeon’s chances in the Vote of No Confidence.""",2150,2569,309,"https://www.facebook.com/136308776480/posts/10157798941386481"
